PlanT2T is a community-driven project. We will show you how to analyze the genome data step by step. You can also contribute to the project by submitting your code to GitHub. We will review and merge your code into the project. Let's work together to make PlanT2T better!

The `0.runAllPipeline.sh` script is used to run the entire pipeline.

```bash
bash 0.runAllPipeline.sh /You/Genome/Pathway/
```
